## Description
Self-feedback is an online website software, a PHP web application developed using the Symfony framework (version 5.4.2).
He has for objectif to send opinion to a meal with a commentary and a specifics opinions to different criteria. 
It also aims to be able to retrieve its opinions in various form to analyze them.

To do this, we made a site in 2 distinct parts:
- A part for users who will only give a review in a form
- A second part, a panel for administrators who can retrieve the reviews in the form of a table and graph that can be consulted on the site or downloaded in PDF format. We have made this part limited to access with a login form with username and password securized.

Thanks to [Symfony](https://symfony.com/)
